<h1>My aims and skills that I want to achive</h1>
<p>Welcome to my page</p>
<p>When taking "Orientation to Software Engineering" course, I want to achive:</p>
<ul> 
<li>Web coding skill:</li>
    <p>I want to be proficient with at least HTML and CSS. I have been learning web coding at home. I find that HTML and CSS is not really complicated to learn. But JavaScript is much harder. And it takes time to get familiar with the logics of this language.</p>
<li>Having an overall understanding about front- end field:</li>
    <p>I always want to work in front- end field in the future. In this course, I hope that I can get a generall view about what should I learn and improve. What I should self- prepare for this career.</p>
<li>Be proficient with tools and information resources:</li>
    <p>In IT field, it is necessary for students to self-study. Thus, knowing about the knowledge resources, for example: which books? which websites? which supporting tools is important for study process. In this course, I want to be clear about those resources. Codecademy, at the moment, is a very useful place where I can study at home.</p>
